### FB-001 — Missing-flyer answer assumed indexed flyer 🟢 Applied
- **Date / reviewer:** 2026-07-15 / Vanessa
- **Question asked:** "A retailer's flyer is missing — what's the usual cause and who fixes it?"
- **What the bot said:** Defaulted to broken indexer → FD.
- **What's actually correct / the issue:** A processor asking this is usually on a
  *processed* (non-indexed) flyer; lead with processing/publishing causes, not the indexer.
- **Article(s) affected:** missing-flyers-and-indexing.md
- **Owner action:** ✅ Applied — added "processed vs indexed" split + processor-default section.
